This comprehensive study focuses on classifying cognitive states using EEG signals, with a particular emphasis on Impasse, Aha!, and Uncertainty. The research utilizes a unique dataset collected from 65 participants who underwent an OSHA safety examination in a mixed-reality environment. The project encompasses various aspects of EEG signal processing and classification, including advanced preprocessing techniques, innovative feature extraction methods, and state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. The study employs a range of methodologies, from traditional summary features to deep learning techniques like EEGNet, E2FNet, Tsception and autoencoders, to enhance the accuracy of cognitive state detection.
